# Customer Satisfaction Analysis Using Power BI

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze customer satisfaction trends using Power BI. The dataset includes information about various factors affecting customer satisfaction, such as service quality, delays, and customer demographics. The goal is to uncover key insights and visualize the data effectively to inform decision-making.

## Features and Visualizations
### 1. **Satisfaction by Customer Type**
   - **Chart Type**: Clustered Column Chart
   - **Purpose**: Compare the count of satisfied vs. dissatisfied customers across different customer types (e.g., Loyal and Disloyal customers).

### 2. **Satisfaction Across Flight Classes**
   - **Chart Type**: Stacked Column Chart
   - **Purpose**: Highlight satisfaction levels based on flight class (Economy, Business, etc.).

### 3. **Correlation Between Delays and Satisfaction**
   - **Chart Type**: Scatter Plot
   - **Purpose**: Examine the relationship between departure/arrival delays and customer satisfaction.

### 4. **Top Factors Influencing Satisfaction**
   - **Chart Type**: Stacked 100% Bar Chart
   - **Purpose**: Visualize the proportion of service ratings (e.g., onboard service, seat comfort) by satisfaction level.

### 5. **Age Group Satisfaction Trends**
   - **Alternative Chart Type**: Stacked Bar Chart
   - **Purpose**: Show how satisfaction levels vary across different age groups.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following key columns:
- **Customer Type**: Type of customer (Loyal/Disloyal).
- **Class**: Flight class (Economy, Business, etc.).
- **Satisfaction**: Satisfaction level (Satisfied/Dissatisfied).
- **Service Ratings**: Ratings for onboard service, seat comfort, inflight entertainment, etc.
- **Delays**: Departure and arrival delays in minutes.
- **Age**: Age of the customer.
